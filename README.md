2nd devChallenge project

## What is it about?

This is a devChallenge's assignment about Responsive Web Desing, but now is a Team blog page

## What technology have I utilized?

HTML & CSS (SCSS)

## How did I do it?

I used Grid to make the columns responsive and added several slats for the top move in the middle column (desktop and tablet layout) and the second column (mobile layout)
